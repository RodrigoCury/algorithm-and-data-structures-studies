        Matrix is a way to store data in an organized form in the form of rows and columns. 
    Matrices are usually used in computer graphics to project 3-dimensional space onto a 2-dimensional screen.
    Matrices in the form of arrays are used to store data in an organized form.

    A matrix is a representation of certain rows and columns, to persist homogeneous data. It can also be called as double-dimensioned array.

    Uses:
        - To represent class hierarchy using Boolean square matrix
        - For data encryption and decryption
        - To represent traffic flow and plumbing in a network
        - To implement graph theory of node representation
